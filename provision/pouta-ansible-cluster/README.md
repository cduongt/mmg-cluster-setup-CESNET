# pouta-ansible-cluster
Ansible playbook and role examples for deploying a cluster in CSC's cPouta cloud

# Overview

This repository is an example of how to setup :

  - Spark and HDFS Cluster based on Hortonworks distribution : Read the [Hortonworks Instructions](playbooks/hortonworks/README.md)

  - Openshift Origin Cluster : Read the [Openshift Instructions](playbooks/openshift/README.md)

This assumes that you already have a bastion host running (See: [Creating a bastion host](CREATE_BASTION_HOST.md))
